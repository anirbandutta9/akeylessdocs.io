== Agent

The agent is at the core of Lightrun. Setting up agents is the most important task once the backend is in place.

TIP: For elaborate agent setups please check out the <<integration.asciidoc#integrations, Agent Integrations>>.

=== Tagging

Tagging lets us group agents together for common functionality under a meaningful name. E.g. Database Servers, Staging, 18GB Machines etc.

We can use any set of tags to define an agent. This would allow binding actions to an agent even before it was launched as well as applying an action to a cross section of servers.

We tag an agent by editing the file `agent.metadata.json` e.g.:

[source,json]
----
{
    "registration": {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "ProductionsAgents"
        },
        {
          "name": "JDK1.8"
        },
        {
          "name": "Ubuntu16"
        }
      ]
    }
}
----

We can add/remove entries within the "tags" section.

NOTE: Changes to this file aren't detected dynamically. An agent restart would be required

Once we bind an action to a tag it will be added implicitly to the tagged agents. This can be useful for many cases. E.g. integration tests can execute with a specific tag, that lets us debug an integration test failure by binding an action based on a tag.

Tags can also be defined in the command line e.g.

[source,bash]

java -Dlightrun.registration.tags=myTag -agentpath:/path/to/agent/lightrun_agent.so RestOfTheArgumentsHere

=== Customization

==== Dynamic Logger
The inserted logs are printed using `java.util.logging` logger.
You can customize the log prints by adding `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/app.properties` to the command line.

==== Agent Config
There are a few parameters we can tune in order to change the agent configuration. The configuration file is located under `<install_dir>/agent/agent.config`.

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
| Parameter Name | Explanation
|`max_dynamic_log_rate` | Number of log prints per second (on average).
|`max_dynamic_log_bytes_rate` | Number of bytes per second (on average).
|`log_stats_time_micros` | How often to log debugger performance stats.
|`max_condition_cost`| Maximum cost in percentage of CPU consumption of condition evaluation.
|`max_log_cpu_cost`| Maximum cost of dynamic logging in percentage of CPU consumption (short bursts are allowed).
|`max_snapshot_buffer_size`| The total size in bytes we allow to evaluate when capturing a snapshot
|`max_snapshot_frame_count`| Max frame count we allow to collect data from when capturing a snapshot
|`breakpoint_expiration_sec`| Breakpoint \ Dynamic log expiration in seconds.
|`dynamic_log_quota_recovery_ms` | Time to pause dynamic log after it runs out of quota.
|`no_check_certificate`| Disable certificate pinning when accessing the backend
|`ignore_quota`| Disable all performance safe guards when evaluating a breakpoint. *Not Recommended*
|`exceptions_monitoring_enabled`| Enable the capturing of the application's exceptions
|`exceptions_monitoring_stdout`| Print all of the captured exceptions to the standard output
|`exceptions_report_percentage`| Process and report only this percentage of the exceptions thrown by the debuggee (A float between 0 and 1.0).
|`exceptions_should_report_caught`| Report exceptions that were caught by the application as well as exceptions that remained uncaught
|`exceptions_max_buffer_size`| The total size in bytes we allow to evaluate when capturing an excpetion (Same as snapshot)
|`exceptions_stack_trace_frame_count`| Max frame count we allow to collect data from when capturing an excpetion (Same as snapshot)
|`enable_pii_redaction`| Enable PII redaction in the agent's side (may have an effect on the application's performance)

==== Agent Command line arguments
Some configurations can be changed with a command line argument.
The command line args come after the agent's path and are separated by a comma:
````-agentpath:<path-to-agent>/lightrun_agent.so=--lightrun_wait_for_init,--lightrun_init_wait_time_ms=5000````

==== Metrics
The agent runs alongside a production application. Hence, it's crucial to monitor and collect important metrics about the overhead of the agent.

The agent prints to it's own log file (usually `/tmp/lightrun_java_agent.INFO`) statistics every `log_stats_time_micros` microseconds.

Listed below are some reported metrics based on the agents logfile.

===== StatsD
Statsd is a network deamon listens for statistics over UDP or TCP and aggregates the data into different backends (e.g Graphite).

There's a short script that performs on-line metric scraping from agent log file  (usually `/tmp/lightrun_java_agent.INFO`).

[source,bash]
----
cd <install-dir>/agent/stats/
./statsd_reporter.py --host <statsd-hostname> --port <statsd-port> --logfile <agent-log-file.txt>
